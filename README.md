## *What I find interesting..*

- It is interesting how I--as an aspiring software engineer and a student taking this course--can learn so much about what effective software development encompasses just by reading about the 'bullshit detection mechanisms' this author outlines for non-technical managers. The article seeks to provide an overview to project managers on how they should frame their conversations, questions, and progress reports with their technical software development teams to 'weed' out ambiguity and generalizations--that tend to stall progress and lead to incomplete, buggy, or undesirable design that fails to meet the expectations of stakeholders. I found the list of phrases (signals of bullshittery) the author references that non-technical managers should watch out for incredibly significant as I often perceive in work environments how the technical chasm between software engineers and their stakeholders can be exploited by the former to feign more accomplishment, understanding, and expertise than is actually there.

- Furthermore, what I found interesting about the author's 'medicine'--so to say--for this problem is that his suggestions are highly analagous to the disciplined process we discussed in lecture and we will employ during this course: Requirements Engineering, such as in how we specifices the importance of setting out user requireemnts. It makes me wonder how much more effectively we may be able to teach good software engineering by framing it from the perspectives of non-technical stakeholders often involved in these projects.

## *What I (Dhiyaa Al Jorf - DoodyShark) find interesting...*

- This article was really interesting because it resonated with some aspects of a project I worked on last year. The project was not managed by non-technical managers, yet their position in the management was that of less involvement. There where points in time when we had to rush in completing tasks right before our biweekly meetings, which often lead to incomplete components that we managed to stear the conversation away from. I'm not the proudest of that of course and I learned a lot from the experience, but what I found to be interesting is that even when the manager is technical, there are pieces of advice from the article that would still work perfectly if the manager is a bit lax or wants to give their team a bit more freedom.
